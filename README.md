# OpenAI-convenient-chatBOT

This project is a Colab notebook that integrates with the ChatGPT-3.5 API to act as a chatbot, which is not only convenient but also useful. The notebook includes built-in keywords in both English and Chinese that you can select to quickly start a chat. Chat records will be saved in "docx" format and stored in the your Google Drive folder at `/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/ChatGPT_API` (It'll be build if the folder isn't exsist). File name are automatically generated by the chatbot. If there're existing chat records in the folder, it can read them and continue the conversation seamlessly.
